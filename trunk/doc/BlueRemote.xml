  <section><title>Requirements</title>
    <para>
      BlueRemote requires a device running Palm OS 5.x (Garnet) and at
      least 150KB of available memory.  A device with a QWERTY
      keyboard is recommended for maximal convenience, although
      BlueRemote is fully usable without one.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can verify your Palm OS version in
      the <emphasis>Info&hellip;</emphasis> screen of your
      system launcher.
    </para>

    <para>
      To connect to your PC, it must have a Bluetooth radio device.
      If your PC does not have built-in Bluetooth support, you can
      pick up a USB Bluetooth dongle at your local hardware store.

  <section>
    <title>Setting Up a Connection to Your PC</title>

    <para>
      To use BlueRemote, you have to connect it to a PC.  The one-time
      connection process has to be initiated from the PC, using its
      Bluetooth software drivers.  In this section we show you how to
      connect BlueRemote to some popular Bluetooth drivers on several
      operating systems.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that BlueRemote does not come with its own set of PC
      drivers, but uses the standard Bluetooth device drivers that
      come with your PC operating system.  By emulating a standard
      Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, BlueRemote is able to control the
      widest variety of Bluetooth systems, including those that we
      can't write device drivers for.
    </para>

    <para>
      Connecting BlueRemote creates a permanent link between the Palm
      device and the PC.  It is therefore normally unnecessary to
      repeat the manual connection process after a Palm reset or a PC
      reboot.  Once it has been connected to a PC, BlueRemote will
      automatically try to reconnect to it on startup.
    </para>

    <screenshot>
      <graphic fileref="images/palm/launcher.jpg" 
	       scale="100" 
	       width="100%"
	       align="center"
	       />
    </screenshot>

    <para>
      Tap on BlueRemote's icon in the system launcher to start
      BlueRemote.
    </para>

    <screenshot>

	       scalefit="0"
	       />
    </screenshot>

    <para>
      On first startup, BlueRemote automatically prompts you
      to create a new connection.
      Tap <emphasis>Connect</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <screenshot>
      <graphic fileref="images/palm/waiting.jpg" 
	       align="center"
	       width="50%"
	       scalefit="0"
	       />
    </screenshot>

    <para>
      Your Palm device is ready to accept connections from your PC.
      The dots should be animated while the device is looking for
      connections.  You will now have to connect to BlueRemote from
      the PC you want to control.
    </para>
    <para>
      To continue, select the operating system that you want to
      control with BlueRemote:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <link linkend="windows">Microsoft Windows XP</link>

	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <link linkend="linux">GNU/Linux (BlueZ Bluetooth Stack)</link>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      If you don't see your system on the above list, please consult
      the documentation that came with the PC.  If your device
      understands the standard Bluetooth HID profile, it is likely
      BlueRemote will work with it.
    </para>

    <section id="windows"><title>Connecting to Microsoft Windows XP</title>
      
      <para>
	Windows XP has several Bluetooth driver implementations from
	various vendors.  Each of them has its own way of connecting
	to BlueRemote.  In this manual, we show step-by-step
	instructions to connect BlueRemote with three popular
	Bluetooth implementations.  First, we have to decide which
	driver is installed on your PC.

      <para>
	To use BlueRemote to control Linux, you will have to use a
	recent version of the <ulink url="http://www.bluez.org">BlueZ
	Bluetooth stack</ulink>.  We have tested BlueRemote with BlueZ
	2.25 and 3.1, but later versions should work equally well.
	BlueZ should already be included in your Linux distribution,
	although the package may not be installed by default.
      </para>

      <para>
	With the BlueZ stack, you will be able to control both the
	Linux text console and X server input.

      <para>
	To get the full feature set of BlueRemote, we suggest to use
	the latest kernel patches available from
	<ulink
	url="http://www.bluez.org/patches.html"><emphasis>http://www.bluez.org/patches.html</emphasis></ulink>.
	BlueRemote will connect to your PC in a limited <emphasis>Boot
	Protocol</emphasis> mode unless the kernel patches are
	installed.  Some features of BlueRemote may not work in Boot
	Protocol mode.
      </para>

      <para>
	Once BlueZ is installed on your PC, you can connect to
	BlueRemote using the <filename>hidd</filename> command-line
	utility.  You will have to know the Bluetooth address of your
	Palm device, which you can get using

      Note that while the key captions shown by BlueRemote correspond

      currently set.  (This is a limitation of the Bluetooth HID
      protocol that is implemented by BlueRemote.)  While this may
      sometimes cause confusion, it also allows you to enter accented
      national characters or special symbols that are not normally
      found on a US layout.

    <title>Controlling the Mouse Pointer</title>

    <para>
      BlueRemote emulates a standard three-button PC mouse with a
      scrolling wheel.
    </para>

      <graphic fileref="images/palm/mouse.jpg" 
	       width="100%"
	       scalefit="0"
	       align="center"
	       />
    </screenshot>
    
    <para>
      You can use the large rectangular area just like a touchpad on a
      notebook computer: drag your finger or stylus across it to move
      the pointer, and tap to click with the currently selected mouse
      button.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can select which mouse button your next tap will click with
      the buttons below the touchpad area.  To support the most
      frequent usage case, the middle and right buttons automatically
      switch back to the left (default) button after you click.
    </para>

    <para>
      To drag with the mouse, check the <emphasis>Drag</emphasis>
      checkbox, position the pointer to the place where you want to
      start dragging, and tap to press and hold the mouse button.  Now
      move the pointer where you want to stop dragging, and tap again
      to release the button.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can use the triangular arrows to the right of the touchpad to
      scroll with the wheel.
    </para>  

    <para>
      In Mouse mode the 5-way navigator is redefined to control the
      mouse pointer.  The center key clicks with the left mouse
      button.
    </para>

    <para>
      If your device has a side key, you can use it to click with the
      left mouse button. The volume keys (if available) control the
      scrolling wheel.  (Note that these keys also work in Keyboard
      mode.)

	   <listitem>
	     <para>
	       The Device Class is a parameter of Bluetooth devices
	       that gives a rough approximation of the type of the
	       device.  For Human Interface Devices, the device
	       subclass indicates if the device is a keyboard, a
	       mouse, or some other peripheral type.
	     </para>
	     
	     <para>
	       BlueRemote includes the device subclass value in its
	       service descriptor record.  The value of this parameter
	       doesn't normally matter, but some Bluetooth software
	       may require a specific value here to be able to connect
	       to BlueRemote.  If you have trouble connecting
	       BlueRemote, experimenting with the Device Subclass
	       setting may work around the problem.
	     </para>

	     <para>
	       BlueRemote advertises the <emphasis>Combo</emphasis>
	       subclass by default.

	   <term><emphasis>Override Device ID</emphasis></term>
	   <listitem>
	     <para>
	       By overriding the Bluetooth Device ID, BlueRemote is
	       able to make your Palm device look like a real
	       Bluetooth peripheral to other devices.
	     </para>

	     <para>
	       This usually makes it easier to connect your Palm as a
	       peripheral, but it might make it harder to use the
	       Bluetooth connection for anything else than remote
	       control.  Therefore, this setting is disabled by
	       default.  When the option is disabled, your Palm will
	       still look like a Palm via Bluetooth; it will advertise
	       its peripheral capabilities by the standard service
	       discovery protocol.
	     </para>

	     <para>
	       If you have trouble connecting BlueRemote to a
	       particular device, try setting this option.  Note that
	       the override is only active while BlueRemote is
	       running.

      You are free to try BlueRemote for ten days without registering it.
      If you want to use it longer, please purchase a registration code at
      <ulink
      url="http://palmgear.com/?xyz=124035">http://palmgear.com/?xyz=124035</ulink>.
      If you register BlueRemote, you will be able to use it as long
      as you like, and if a new version of BlueRemote is released, we
      will provide you with free upgrades for at least one full year.
    </para>

    <para>
      Your registration code will be 8 characters long and it will
      consist of a mixture of digits and upper-case
      letters.  <keycap>LK8CVB61</keycap> is an example of a
      registration code.  Note that the code is tied to your HotSync
      id; if you later change your HotSync id, your code will not
      work.  In this case, please contact us at
      <ulink url="mailto:support@fnord.hu">support@fnord.hu</ulink>
      and describe the problem: we will likely be able to supply you
      with a replacement code.  (Note that we can only give you a
      limited number of replacement codes.)
