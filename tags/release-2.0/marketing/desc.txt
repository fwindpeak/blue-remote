Remote control your PC by turning your Palm into a Bluetooth peripheral!

BlueRemote turns your Palm device into a standard Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.

BlueRemote works with most operating systems, including Microsoft Windows XP, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux. There is no need to install special software on the PC: BlueRemote works fine with the standard drivers that come with your system!

Tap on on-screen buttons, use Graffiti input or use your device's built-in keyboard to enter any key on a standard PC keyboard.

Use your touchscreen just like a notebook's touchpad, or use your five-way navigator to move the mouse pointer on the PC.

Enter shortcuts such as Control-C, Alt-F, or even the mighty Control-Alt-Del directly on your Treo keyboard! Works on all OS5.x Treo devices, including the new 700p.

Try before you buy! BlueRemote is free to try for ten days, after which you will have to purchase a registration code.
